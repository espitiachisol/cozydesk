# CozyDesk (Desktop-Simulated WebApp)

This project is a WebApp designed to simulate the experience of a desktop environment, with all functionalities developed around this core concept.

> I am currently refactoring the project; this is the second version of CozyDesk. Some features have been completed in this version. For a complete set of features, please refer to the [original project](https://cozydesk-861ed.web.app/).

## Features
### Desktop Windows

Key Techniques: Compound Pattern, Custom Hooks, Context API, Debouncing

- Dragging and Resizing: 
  - Developed custom hooks (`useWindowDrag` and `useWindowResize`) to manage dragging and resizing behaviors.
  - Implemented boundary constraints by passing a container ref, ensuring windows stay within defined boundaries during both dragging and resizing operations.

- Customizable Draggable Area:
Utilized the **Compound Pattern**, allowing for the customization of draggable areas within the window component.

- Integrated a **debounce strategy** to enhance performance, ensuring that window position/size are updated only after the drag operation is completed, thereby reducing unnecessary server requests.

### Music Player and Playlist

Key Techniques: Audio Player from scratch, Drag-and-Drop File Upload, Contextual Menu Component

- Developed a fully functional music player from scratch, providing essential playback controls, including play, pause, stop, next, previous, and loop features.
- Enabled users to upload their music files by simply dragging and dropping them into the designated folder, automatically adding them to their personal playlist.
- The Contextual Menu component displays an overlay menu when users right-click on a target element, enabling context-specific actions. It’s built using the Compound Pattern for flexibility and ease of use.

### Others

### Toaster Notifications
Key Techniques: Promise Toast, Queue Data Structure

- Developed a Toaster component to display various types of notifications (success, error, info, promise) using a **queue data structure**. This ensures that notifications are managed efficiently and displayed in the correct order.

- Implemented support for promise-based toasts, allowing notifications to update dynamically based on the resolution or rejection of a promise.

## Frontend Technique
### React(Functional component)

### Semantic HTML
Implementing semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility and code readability.

### Development Tools
- Vite
- Prettier and ESLint
    Integrated Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting and quality assurance.

### Cloud Services
